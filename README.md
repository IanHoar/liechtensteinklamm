# Liechtensteinklamm

Liechtensteinklamm is an abstraction layer of UISplitViewControllerâ€™s delegate
methods. It helps you perform common tasks by implementing protocols on your
`SplitViewDelegate` subclass.

Liechtensteinklamm basically forces you to have a UINavigationController as the
root view controller of both the primary and secondary regions.
